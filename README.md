# Ket Bitwise Simulator

Ket Bitwise Simulator (kbw) is the quantum computer simulator of the Ket
quantum programming. The simulator executes Ket Quantum Assembly codes (.kqasm)
generated by the libket (and the Ket quantum programming language), using the
bitwise representation [[arxiv:2004.03560](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03560)]. 

## Installation
