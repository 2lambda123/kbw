# Ket Bitwise Simulator

Ket Bitwise Simulator (KBW) is the quantum computer simulator of the Ket
Quantum Programming. The simulator executes Ket Quantum Assembly (.kqasm) files
generated by the libket (and the Ket quantum programming language), using the
bitwise representation [[arxiv:2004.03560](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03560)]. 

## Installation

The kbw is available in most Linux distribution through the Snap Store.

> Information on how to enable Snap on your Linux distribution is available on
