title: Ket Bitwise Simulator
summary: Quantum computer simulator for the Ket Quantum Programming
description: |
  The Ket Bitwise Simulator executes Ket Quantum Assembly (.kqasm) files
  generated by the Libket, using the bitwise representation. It is also
  necessary by the Ket quantum programming language to simulate quantum
  execution.

  This project is part of the Ket Quantum Programming framework that also
  features:

  * The Ket quantum programming language;
  * The C++ quantum programming library Libket.

  See the documentation for more information http://ket.readthedocs.io.
